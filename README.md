# DDS Midterm Case Study - Fall 2024
Hi and welcome!  This repository serves as my midterm submission for Doing Data Science in the MSDS program at SMU.  

## Overview

The premise of this assignment was to simulate a client engagement project from start to finish.  Specifically, this project is for Frito-Lay, who wishes to predict employee attrition using their business data and has engaged us to help solve this problem. 

## Requirements

The "client" has a few requirements for this project. 

 - 2 Models
	 - Naive Bayes or
	 - KNN
 - Metrics
	 - 60% specificity
	 - 60% sensitivity
 - Language
	 - R

## Files

The main file in the library is:  **MidTerm_EDA_Modeling.RMD**.  In it, you will find most of the final code used for the project.  It will be lengthly, as it reflects part of my iterative learning process.  I would try something out one day, let the code run for hours, only to come back and realize there was a better way after doing more research.  I thought it more helpful to keep the code iterations than to simply show the end product, at least in a school project setting. 
	


## Results TBD

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Single backticks|`'Isn't this fun?'`            |'Isn't this fun?'            |
|Quotes          |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            |
|Dashes          |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash|
